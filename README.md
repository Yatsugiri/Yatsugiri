- 👋 Hi, I’m @Yatsugiri. Yatsugiri-ban is the Japanese word for an older picture format about 6.5 x 8.5 inches. 
- 👀 I’m interested in using 3D printing to extend the life of vintage products -- particularly, large format film cameras. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Marlin firmware for 3D printing. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to increase the functionality, precision, and strength of 3D printed parts.
